Make ClassnameA work all by itself, with no global or class variables.
Can import from classes that you will NOT also need to import for the new ClassnameB.

Any value you will need in another class should be the return value for a method
in ClassnameA.

To use ClassnameA and its methods and variables in ClassnameB:
	1. Import the ClassnameA file.
	2. In the __init__ method of ClassnameB, create a self.variable that is the
        whole class, create a self.variable for any value you want to use.
	3. Then use the self.variables created in the __init__ of the new class.

You can't have circular imports, with ClassA importing ClassB and then ClassB
importing ClassA.

See the class_b file for syntax examples and output examples.
